# covid-19 cases in the US

Like many peole, I have been stressed out about the covid-19 pandemic. Somehow analyzing data helps relieve my stress. So, I put together a quick `gganimate` plot to illustrate the cases of covid-19 in the US by state/territory.

See the covid_US_updated.md file for the most up to date information. I switched to using data from the NYT. The covid_cases_US.md file is out of date. 

The app (in the shiny_app folder) allows you to choose states/territories and compare curves. You can access the app directly at [https://lisalendway.shinyapps.io/covid-19_app/](https://lisalendway.shinyapps.io/covid-19_app/).
